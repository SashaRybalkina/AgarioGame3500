# Comments to Evaluators:

This project represents the Model in MVC. It contains five classes: GameObjects, Food (subclass of GameObjects), 
Player (subclass of GameObjects), Protocols, and World. The AgarioModels contains all the necessary functions 
and properties to build the game world. It stores the status of the game objects and state of the game.

# Assignments Specific Topics:

MVC, Inheritance, Protocols, SOLID principles, GSPs, Pair Programming.

# References:

  We referenced our own code from TowardAgarioOne/Two/Three.
   
# Time Expenditures:

    Predicted Hours:       5           Actual Hours:           3
    All the work were done through pair programming, thus the time expenditures for each member were the same.

# Partnerships:

All the work were done through pair programming (side by side coding).

# Testing:

Since this project works as a model for the actual game GUI, we tested its functionality by starting the 
game and testing if the game functions as expected. 

# Branching:

We did all work for this project (AgarioModels) in the main branch.
